[< Previous Challenge](./challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./challenge-01.md)


## Introduction 

The Spring Boot application uses JPA and supports both in memory databases as well as MySQL. In this challenge we'll put our database on Azure while the code is running locally. Taking baby steps :)

## Description

Create a MySQL database on Azure and make sure that the application (running locally) can connect to it without changing any code.

## Success Criteria

1. Verify functionality by creating a new owner, a new pet and a new visit 
1. Connect to the database through cloud shell 
1. Verify that the tables include the newly created entities (owner/pet/visit) 
1. No file needs to be changed for this challenge
