# Challenge 8: Replication

[< Previous Challenge](./07-private-endpoint.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** 

## Coach Tips

1) After they complete this one, remind the attendee to delete the replica since it will increase billing while it is running. 
1) If the attendee has extra time, consider challenging them with doing a database failover where they stop the replication and configuring the application to use the replica instead.
