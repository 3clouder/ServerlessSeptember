## Linux History

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world’s smartphones are powered by Linux.

## Learning Objectives
In this hack you will be challenged with some common tasks from a real world scenario in Linux administration duties, such as:

1. Create a Linux Virtual Machine on Azure
2. Handle files and directories
3. Maninpulate file contents
4. Work with standard linux permissions
5. Collect information about Linux process in your environment
6. Management of users and groups
7. Basic shell scripting 
8. Work with disks,  partitions and logical volume manager
9. Linux package management 
10. Implement a basic webserver 

## Challenges

The challenges were organized as below. Please note:

Each challenge can be done separately and they are not interdependent.
You don't need to make all of them, chose as many you want.
The level of complexity increases accordingly with the respective number of each one.
The Linux man pages are your best friend. Make sure to use as best you can.

## Prerequisites
- Your own Azure subscription with contributor access 
- Access to a terminal. The terms “terminal,” “shell,” and “command line interface” are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them:

	* A terminal is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell.
	* A shell is a program that exposes the computer’s operating system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a terminal is a command line interpreter.
	* A command line interface is a user interface (managed by a command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer program and outputs the results.
When someone refers to one of these three terms in the context of Linux, they generally mean a terminal environment where you can run commands and see the results printed out to the terminal.

		Becoming a Linux expert requires you to be comfortable with using a terminal. Any administrative task, including file manipulation, package installation, and user management, can be accomplished through the terminal. The terminal is interactive: you specify commands to run and the terminal outputs the results of those commands. To execute any command, you type it into the prompt and press ENTER.

		For our activites, it is recommended to use the [Azure Cloud Shell](http://shell.azure.com/).


- There are some basic concepts that will be nice if you have them. If you would like to take a look they are [listed here](./Student/resources/concepts.md).
-  Concepts around the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) are recommended, so you can get more details about it [here](./Student/resources/fhs.md).
- Regarding Linux commands, just for reference, [here is](./Student/resources/commands.md) a good cheat sheet.
