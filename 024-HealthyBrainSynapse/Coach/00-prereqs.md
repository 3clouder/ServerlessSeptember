## Notes and Guidance
- Make sure that you have joined the Teams group for this track. The first person/coach on your team at your table should create a new channel in this Team with your team name.
- Install the recommended toolset:
    - Web browser to interact with Azure Portal and web-based data tools
    - [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
- Make sure your team creates the Teams channel for their team
- PowerBI Desktop is to be installed on their desktops
- Access to a web browser should be allowed as well
- Run the lab notebook and make the output data ("/dailyReports/", "/initialData/") available
- The lab notebook will split the data from OpenPowerlifting.org into an initial dataset and daily incremental datasets. This will be important in Challenge 4
