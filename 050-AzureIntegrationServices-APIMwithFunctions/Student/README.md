# WhatTheHack - Azure Integration Services - API Management with Function Apps

## Introduction
Welcome to the student's guide for the Azure Integration Services - API Management with Function Apps Hack. 

The Azure Integration Services (AIS) Hack will provide you a deep dive experience in building a solution that seamlessly connect apps to services whether hosted on premises or in the cloud.  This hack - the first of many series - will enable participants to solve common business scenarios our customers face when building AIS from ground-up, from deploying, configuring and securing API management and its backend services. 


## Learning Objectives
In this hack, the participants will learn how to build an integration solutin using API Management and Function Apps.  This involves the following:

1. Authoring Bicep templates to build API Management Service and backend APIs hosted in Function Apps
2. Creating CI/CD pipeline to deploy environment
3. Securing backend API services via OAuth
4. Securing backend API services over the VNET


## Challenges
-  Challenge 0: **[Prepare your Development Environment](Challenge-00.md)**
   - Get yourself ready to build your integration solution
-  Challenge 1: **[Provision an Integration Environment](Challenge-01.md)**
   - Create a bicep template that will provision a baseline integration environment.
-  Challenge 2: **[Deploy your Integration Environment](Challenge-02.md)**
   - Create a CI/CD pipeline to do automated deployment of your integration environment.
-  Challenge 3: **[Create Backend API](Challenge-03.md)**
   - Create backend APIs
-  Challenge 4: **[Secure Backend APIs](Challenge-04.md)**
   - Securing backend APIs by configuring them in the VNET or by using OAuth 2.0 authorization
