# Challenge 02 - Create a Hello World Function

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

Azure Functions are an integral part of a Serverless architecture.  Azure Functions allows you to run small pieces of code (called "functions") without worrying about application infrastructure. With Azure Functions, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date servers you need to keep your application running at scale.

## Description

- Create a "Hello World" Azure Function in Visual Studio Code that:
    - Takes a name as an input parameter.
    - Returns the name back to you as an output.

## Success Criteria

1. Verify that you are able to open your function in a browser and pass your name in the query string.  You should see a message like:
*Hello, YourName. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.*
1. Understand the basic parts of an Azure Function's code and how to publish it to Azure
1. Provide your team's Function App public URL to the Proctor group as your proof artifact, e.g. [https://mytempfunction.azurewebsites.net/api/myhttptrigger?name=Buddy+The+Elf](https://mytempfunction.azurewebsites.net/api/myhttptrigger?name=Buddy+The+Elf)
