Over a period of time, thier security engineers built sophisticated security policies which every IT team in Mango Inc has to follow mandatorily. As systems are moving to Azure, they would like to use native services as much as possible while maintaining established standards. Design end to end proactive and reactive monitoring for SAP infrastructure with easy to understand dashboards.

-   **Challenge #4: [Business continuity and Disaster recovery](Student/04-Business Continuity and DR.md)**

Mango Inc heavily relies on SAP infrastructure to perform day to day business transactions. Unavailability of IT infrastructure for SAP or SAP application itself can heavily impact business transactions and potentially delay revenue recognition. Mango Inc is concerning about the data consistency on backups and restorability with online backups and necessity of offline backups along with periodicity. CIO heard about Azure netapp files and its features and took a decision to use ANF across the SAP infrastructure for Hana database. Design and implement BCDR solution for SAP S/4 Hana system.

As Mango Inc has established SAP landscape. Now Mango Inc wants to enable users with simplified mobile user interface that requires data from multiple sources and one of the data source is S/4 Hana system.

-  **Challenge #6: [Application aware maintenance (Start/Stop/Scale)](Student/06-Start-Stop-Automation.md)**

Mango Inc is looking to optimize the cost of SAP landscape and exploring ways to do that. They're leaning towards getting Reserves Instances (RI) for all production systems and would like to save cost on non-production (sandboxes, project systems, etc.) systems by not operating those during non-business hours. This solution helps them achieve that either using automation tools or schedule based.
