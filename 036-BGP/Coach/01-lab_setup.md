# Challenge 1: Environment Setup - Coach's Guide

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-enable_bgp.md)

## Notes and Guidance

The script [bgp.sh](../Student/Resources/bgp.sh) can be used to create the basic topology. This script has been tested to run in the Azure Cloud shell, and takes around 1 hour to complete.

Participants have reportedly struggled with the scripts, sometimes because of not having enough privilege to accept the Cisco CSR Marketplace image, sometimes for other issues.

Hence it is recommended that the coach runs this script previous to the actual event, or at least one participant has tested it.

The resources can of course be created manually, but participants often get a "waste of time" feeling when investing a long time in creating Azure resources and configuring IPsec tunnels.

### Inspecting the Environment

The effective routes in the Vnets only show the local prefixes, plus the /32 prefixes configured for the VPN tunnels:

```
az network nic show-effective-route-table -n testvm1VMNic -g $rg -o table
Source                 State    Address Prefix    Next Hop Type          Next Hop IP
---------------------  -------  ----------------  ---------------------  --------------
Default                Active   10.1.0.0/16       VnetLocal
VirtualNetworkGateway  Active   10.2.0.5/32       VirtualNetworkGateway  40.127.161.185
VirtualNetworkGateway  Active   10.2.0.4/32       VirtualNetworkGateway  40.127.161.185
VirtualNetworkGateway  Active   10.3.0.10/32      VirtualNetworkGateway  40.127.161.185
VirtualNetworkGateway  Active   10.4.0.10/32      VirtualNetworkGateway  40.127.161.185
Default                Active   0.0.0.0/0         Internet
Default                Active   10.0.0.0/8        None
Default                Active   100.64.0.0/10     None
Default                Active   192.168.0.0/16    None
Default                Active   25.33.80.0/20     None
Default                Active   25.41.3.0/25      None
```

By the way, if you look at the effective routes in Vnet2, you will notice a difference in the next hop: with active/passive gateways the next hop is the public IP of the VPN gateway, with active/active the next hops are the private IPs (not that this is too important for this challenge):

```
 az network nic show-effective-route-table -n testvm2VMNic -g $rg -o table
Source                 State    Address Prefix    Next Hop Type          Next Hop IP

VirtualNetworkGateway  Active   10.4.0.10/32      VirtualNetworkGateway  10.2.0.5
Default                Active   0.0.0.0/0         Internet
Default                Active   10.0.0.0/8        None
Default                Active   100.64.0.0/10     None
Default                Active   192.168.0.0/16    None
Default                Active   25.33.80.0/20     None
Default                Active   25.41.3.0/25      None
```

Two Virtual Network Gateways have been deployed:

```

Note that the deployment script enables BGP in the gateway resources, but not in the VPN connections:

The onprem routers know some routes, but not the Vnet prefixes. For example, CSR3 knows about CSR4 and about CSR5 (the onprem prefix 10.5.0.0/16) because the script connected CSR4 and CSR5 via iBGP, but not about Vnets 1 and 2:

```

You can verify connectivity between the VMs in the branches and the core MPLS network. In this example, we are testing connectivity between the vnets of CSR3 and CSR5:

```
‚ùØ testvm3=$(az network public-ip show -n testvm3-pip -g $rg --query ipAddress -o tsv)
‚ùØ ssh -n -o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no "$testvm3" "ping 10.5.1.4 -c 5"
