# Challenge 7 - Default Routing

[< Previous Challenge](./06-communities.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./08-vng_ibgp.md)

## Notes and Guidance

Injecting a default route over VPN is a common scenario:

- Forced Tunnelling to an on-prem firewall
- Security Partners in Virtual WAN such as zScaler

Make sure the participants note that nothing needed to be configured at the VPN Gateway as [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm) describes for static routing site-to-site connections, with the "default site" concept.
