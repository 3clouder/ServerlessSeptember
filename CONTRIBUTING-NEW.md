# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in What The Hack!

Contributions come in many forms: submitting issues, improving an existing hack, and of course developing new hacks.

This document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to the What The Hack project.

## Issues

The primary way to engage and get in touch with the What The Hack team is to submit an issue via Github. This section describes the guidelines for submitting issues.

### Issue Types

There are 5 types of issues:

- Issue/Bug: You've found a bug in a hack and want to report it, create an issue to track the bug.
- Issue/Discussion: You have a suggestion on how to improve an existing hack.
- Issue/Proposal: Used to propose a new hack. This will get the What The Hack team to engage with you and plug you into our contribution process.
- Issue/Request: Want help hosting a WTH event? WTH content is self-serve, but we're happy to meet with you and walk you through how to do it.
- Issue/Report: Want to share with us that you hosted a WTH event? We'd love to know how and where WTH content is being used. Give us your feedback, and let us know!

### Before You File

Before you file an issue, make sure you've checked the following:

1. Check for existing issues
    - Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
    - If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reaction-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction:
        - üëç up-vote
        - üëé down-vote
1. For bugs
    - You have as much data as possible. Let us know which hack has the bug. Is it in the Student guide? Coach guide? Is it a documentation issue? Or an issue with a provided resource file or solution file?
1. For proposals
    - Is this a net new hack topic, or should your contribution extend or modify and existing hack?
    - It is okay to have more than one hack on the same technology, but the new hack should be an independent set of challenges that stand on their own.

### Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests. To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:

1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.
1. Read the [What The Hack Author's Guide](./000-HowToHack/WTH-HowToAuthorAHack.md).
1. Fork the **WhatTheHack** repo into your own Github account and create a new branch
1. Create your change
    - Modify an existing hack.
    - Or, scaffold out your new hack with the markdown templates provided in the [WTH Author's Guide](./000-HowToHack/WTH-HowToAuthorAHack.md), then author your new hack. 
1. Re-Read the [What The Hack Author's Guide](./000-HowToHack/WTH-HowToAuthorAHack.md) (seriously) and make sure your hack follows the templates & styles for consistency.
1. Let the What The Hack team 
1. Commit and open a PR
1. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green
1. A maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days

### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback

A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a "Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the **do-not-merge** label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.

### Use of Third-party code

- Third-party code must include licenses.

**Thank You!** - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
