# Challenge 1: Gathering Open Powerlifting Data

[< Previous Challenge](./01-data-gathering.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./03-visualization.md)

## Introduction
Now data has been put into a central location, how do you work with it?

## Description
The data has been loaded into a cloud storage service. Your teams next task is to load the data to a platform where querying and reporting tools can be used.  In later challenges, you will need to visualize the data using tables/graphs/maps.  You will also need to be able to secure the data, including with data masking, entity and/or column level access control, and encryption.

Your method of loading should anticipate that later files with the same structure will need to be loaded to keep the database/warehouse up-to-date.  You can make the simplifying assumption that all future files will only contain new records (i.e., INSERTs).

## Success Criteria

1. Create and describe the data model
2. Describe the steps taken to load the data
3. Show the populated data model and workspace to your coach
Bonus
- Explain the data distribution methodologies used and why
