# Coaches Resources

1. Lab Data Prep.ipynb : A Python notebook that splits the Open Powerlifting data into an initial historical data file and a chosen number of daily incremental files.  To be run in a Synapse Workspace.
2. Sample Visualizations : two example Power BI visulizations that illustrate a solution to Challenge 3.  Consider these a minimum bar which the Hack team will hopefully exceed.
