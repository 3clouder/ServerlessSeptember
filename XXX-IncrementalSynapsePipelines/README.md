# Automating Incremental Pipelines <br> (Azure SQL -> Synapse Dedicated Pool)

## Introduction
If you accept the challenge to attend, you and your teammates will work together to help take data from a transactional Azure SQL database and copy it into a Synapse Dedicated Pool to be used as a reporting warehouse.  

But wait there’s more!  As you add data to your transactional database, it needs to automatically make it to the proper tables in the reporting warehouse so we can see the changes in near real time in a report.  

Four words…  <B>Trigger an Incremental Copy</B>.

## Challenges
- Challenge 0: **[Setup the source and target environments](Student/Challenge-00.md)**
   - Standup and configure the Azure SQL and Synapse Environments
- Challenge 1: **[Initial Data Load into the Dedicated Pool](Student/Challenge-01.md)**
   - Use Synapse Pipelines to perform the initial data load
- Challenge 2: **[Create Incremental Load Pipelines](Student/Challenge-02.md)**
   - Implement Change Data Capture, create the synapse pipelines and the proper Dedicated Pool architecture to be used as a target for the pipelines and a source for reporting.
- Challenge 3: **[Setup the trigger to automate the incremental load](Student/Challenge-03.md)**
   - Create the trigger within Synapse to automate the pipeline and add data to SQL and watch it flow through the staging and production tables in the dedicated pool and viewable in your Power BI Report.

## Prerequisites
