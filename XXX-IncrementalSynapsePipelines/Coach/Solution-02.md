[< Previous Challenge](Solution-01.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance

There are sample SQL scripts to in the Student/Resources folder to help with enabling and querying the Change Data Capture functionality within the Azure SQL database.

There are also sample SQL scripts to use to create the Insert, Update and Delete SPs in the Dedicated Pool.  

Make sure the students review the PoC word document as there are plenty of tips for them to use as they progress along in this challenge.

Also, you can expand this component to examine [Change Data Capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) in Azure SQL further.  It is up to you as a coach with regards to how deep you would like to get on this topic.
