# Challenge 2: Size analysis

[< Previous Challenge](./01-assessment.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./03-offline-migration.md)

## Introduction

Determine the CPU/memory configuration, database I/O and file size and map to an equivalent size in Azure

## Description

In this challenge you'll determine the CPU/memory configuration, database I/O and database file size required and map it to an equivalent size in Azure. You will run a synthetic benchmark to simulate I/O for the database. 

To run the synthetic benchmark:
*
*
*

## Success Criteria

1. You have discovered the CPU/memory configuration for your database server
1. You have discovered the database file size
1. You have discovered the I/O requirements for the database
1. You can explain to your proctor the criteria for selecting a database service tier (e.g. Basic, General Purpose or Memory Optimized)
1. You can explain to your proctor why you would go with a specific database deployment option (Single Server, Flexible Server or HyperScale (Postgres only))
